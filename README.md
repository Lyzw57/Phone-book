# Phone book

## It is exercise from coursera Python course. Slightly modyfied

The following uses a CSV file to store the data for a small telephone directory.
It is menu driven. That is, it presents a menu of choices. These choices are
to show the whole directory, create a new entry for the directory, delete an
entry from the directory, and edit an entry in the directory.

I created this repo to start making good habits and work with git.
Code isn't only mine.
